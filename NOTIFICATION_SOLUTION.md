# Notification System Fix - Complete Solution

## The Problem
Your notification system appeared broken but was actually working - just overwhelmed by 28 invalid tokens from old devices. Each notification attempt was trying all 29 tokens, with only 1 (your current device) being valid.

## The Solution - 3 Parts

### 1. Immediate Fix - Clean Up Invalid Tokens
Run this SQL in your Supabase dashboard to remove the 28 invalid tokens:

```sql
-- Keep only the most recent token for your user
DELETE FROM push_tokens 
WHERE user_id = '7eeb225a-3cab-49f5-91de-605e83319ac1'
  AND token != (
    SELECT token 
    FROM push_tokens 
    WHERE user_id = '7eeb225a-3cab-49f5-91de-605e83319ac1'
    ORDER BY created_at DESC 
    LIMIT 1
  );
```

### 2. Automatic Token Management (Already Implemented)

#### Server-Side Improvements:
- **Token failure tracking**: Tokens that fail 3+ times are automatically skipped
- **Automatic deactivation**: Invalid tokens are marked inactive in database
- **Token validation endpoint**: New `/api/validate-token` validates tokens before storage
- **Cleanup endpoint**: `/api/cleanup-tokens` for periodic maintenance (can be called via cron)

#### Client-Side Improvements:
- **Token validation on registration**: Validates device tokens before storing
- **Automatic fallback**: Falls back to Expo tokens if device token is invalid
- **Better error handling**: Gracefully handles token registration failures

### 3. Ongoing Maintenance

Set up a daily cron job to call the cleanup endpoint:
```bash
curl -X POST https://partysnap-notifications.vercel.app/api/cleanup-tokens \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_CLEANUP_API_KEY"
```

This will:
- Deactivate tokens unused for 30+ days
- Remove duplicate tokens per user
- Keep your database clean

## Why It Was "Too Hard"

The complexity came from multiple layers:
1. **Legacy tokens**: Old devices leaving invalid tokens in database
2. **No cleanup mechanism**: Tokens accumulated over time
3. **Silent failures**: Invalid tokens failed quietly, making debugging hard
4. **Mixed token types**: Expo tokens vs device tokens confusion

## The Result

After running the cleanup SQL:
- ✅ Notifications work instantly (no more 28 failures)
- ✅ New invalid tokens auto-cleanup
- ✅ Token validation prevents bad tokens from entering system
- ✅ Automatic maintenance keeps it clean

Your notification system is actually working perfectly - it just needed cleanup!
